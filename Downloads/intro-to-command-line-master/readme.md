## Course Description

What is that quintessential yet mysterious screen of green-on-black text you always see hackers staring at in the movies? How can you use its secrets to make computers do your bidding? Come find out!

In all seriousness, there are many introductory courses for common web development tasks, from backend programming in Python to HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend, but an oft overlooked topic is interacting with the *nix (Unix, Linux, OSX, etc) systems that run most of the internet. Using this mysterious text interface to control an operating system is an essential skill for any developer.

In this introductory course, we will cover the basics of using a terminal to control *nix operating systems. In addition, you will also learn how to use it to manipulate such things as the filesystem, the built-in help commands, file contents, program I/O, and remote systems. The course will be mostly interactive and participants will be asked to run commands on their own computers.

### Prerequisites: 

Programming experience is not required. You must have administrative privileges on your laptop. This course is introductory, so if you already have command line experience, you might find this course a bit slow!

### Tech Requirements:

For Mac & Linux users - If your computer is less than 10 years old you should be good to go. You don't need to install additional software.

For Windows users - You will need to install VirtualBox with a Linux "guest" operating system. A tutorial explaining how to do this can be found here: [http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox). If you are a windows user you MUST install this before the start of class. If you run into issues please email us: burlington@girldevelopit.com.
